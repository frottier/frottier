- 🌱 I am currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on ... —nothing really comes to mind. I'm more of a me-person.
- 📫 How to reach me: You could try [@dasfrottier@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@dasfrottier) ~~or [@dasfrottier](https://twitter.com/dasfrottier) as long as the birdsite is not completely burned to the ground.~~ Good luck!
